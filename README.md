# the what
monOS is a 64-bit monolithic hobby OS written in Rust themed after the vtuber [Mono Monet](https://www.youtube.com/@MonoMonet) of V4Mirai.

# the why
making a hobby OS has been something i've wanted to do for quite a while, but never quite got around to.
when i watched mono's [TempleOS stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhbR5h6lw98), it sort of brought the idea back into my head - together with a quite obvious theme :P

for the same reason, monOS has quite a lot of references to TempleOS.

# the boring stuff (aka implementation details)
because i like torturing myself (and for educational reasons) the kernel uses no external dependencies apart from the [bootloader](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader).
during development i handled this by first getting a basic implementation running using the [x86_64 crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64) and then gradually substituting it with my own implementations.
this made things a lot less painful than writing everything from scratch directly.

monOS is bootable from both BIOS and UEFI. that being said, most of my own testing was done on UEFI. therefore i recomend always using the UEFI image if you can!

### memory
frames are allocated using a basic bitmap allocator. heap memory is allocated using a linked list allocator.

#### kernel virtual address space (horribleness ahead)
i ~~plan to~~ really really need to automatically assign new virtual adresses at some point but for now this will have to suffice

| adress         | size  | mapped to               |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------- |
| 0xfee00000     | 4KiB  | local apic              |
| 0xfee10000     | 4KiB+ | acpi tables             |
| 0xfee30000     | 4KiB  | io apic                 |
| 0x123456780000 | ????  | framebuffer back buffer |
| 0x444444440000 | 1MiB  | kernel heap             |
